# Task Management Application (Task Manager)

## 🎯 Project Goals

A simple web application for managing personal or small team tasks. Key planned features include:

* Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD).
* Task categorization (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
* Task status assignment (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
* Setting due dates.
* (Maybe) Task prioritization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Laravel (PHP Framework)
* **Frontend:** (To be determined - possibly Blade with a bit of JavaScript, or a JS framework like Vue.js if complexity increases)
* **Database:** (To be determined - likely MySQL or PostgreSQL)
* **Development Tools:** Composer, Artisan CLI

## ⚙️ Installation

    cd [project directory name]
    ```
2.  Install Composer dependencies:

3.  Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure database settings:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit the .env file according to your database configuration
    nano .env
    ```
4.  Generate the application key:

    php artisan key:generate
    ```
5.  Migrate the database and run seeders (if any):

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
